# cryptoZombies

*cryptoZombies* is the most common platform for developers to learn Solidity and about development on Ethereum, the programmable blockchain. It is a course started by *Loom Network*, that talks about variety of concepts of solidity starting from what a contract is and in detail to what tokens are.

Taking an early initiative, access to special lessons was provided (Lessons 7 & 8) for creating custom game elements to their CCG/TCG game called Relentless (earlier called Zombie Battleground)

More courses were added for how to test with truffle and how to build oracles. Furthermore development with zkSync and advanced concepts for zkSync.
