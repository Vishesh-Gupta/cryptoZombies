# cryptoZombies

*cryptoZombies* is the most common platform for developers to learn Solidity and about development on Ethereum, the programmable blockchain. It is a course started by *Loom Network*, that talks about variety of concepts of solidity starting from what a contract is and in detail to what tokens are an

Taking an early initiative, access to special lessons was provided (Lessons 7 & 8) for creating custom game elements to their CCG/TCG game called Relentless (earlier called Zombie Battleground)

Recently, after the news from Facebook launching `libra`, courses on that were added.
